Using grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations, the study evaluated the methane storage capacity of these frameworks, identifying top-performing materials, outperforming the best methane storage materials currently available.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the necessary libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`pandas`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures, like DataFrames, which make it easy to work with structured data, similar to tables in Excel or SQL. You can use pandas to clean, transform, and analyze data effectively.\n",
    "- [`scikit-learn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) is a widely used machine learning library in Python. It offers a range of tools for building and evaluating machine learning models, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Scikit-learn is great for experimenting with models and understanding core ML concepts.\n",
    "- [`matplotlib`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) is a foundational plotting library in Python. It provides extensive control over plots, making it useful for creating static, high-quality visuals for data analysis. Matplotlib is also the base upon which many other plotting libraries, like seaborn, are built.\n",
    "- [`seaborn`](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics and is especially useful for data exploration and creating visually appealing plots with minimal code.\n",
    "- [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) is a Python library used for creating progress bars, which make it easy to monitor the progress of loops or tasks in your code. It‚Äôs especially handy when running long operations, like data processing or training machine learning models, as it gives a real-time view of how much work is left. You can add tqdm to any iterable, and it will automatically display a progress bar that updates as the loop iterates."
